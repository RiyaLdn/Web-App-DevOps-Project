- **Data Validation:** Ensure data accuracy and completeness with required fields, date restrictions, and card number validation.

## Reverted Feature

- **Delivery Date:** The Delivery Date feature was designed to easily track the delivery date for orders being made. While the feature has been reverted, this section provides insights into its purpose and functionality. 

### Re-Implementing the Feature

To re-implement the delivery date feature, follow the steps below: 

1. **Step 1:** Modify the order class in the `app.py` file. Add a `delivery-date` column to the class attributes.
2. **Step 2:** In the route to add orders section of code, `app.route`, update the form to include the `deliver_date` field.
3. **Step 3:** Also in the route to add orders section of code, `app.route`, add `delivery_date` to the bottom of the `new_order` variables list.
4. **Step 4:** In the `order.html` template, update the table header and rows to include the `delivery_date` column. Modify the `<th>` elements and the `{% for order in orders %}` loop accordingly.
5. **Step 5:** Again, in the `order.html` template, modify the `<form>` element to include an input field for the `delivery_date` column.

These are all the steps necessary to facilitate all the functionality of the web application to support a new column `delivery_date`.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For the application to succesfully run, you need to install the following packages:

- flask (version 2.2.2)
- pyodbc (version 4.0.39)
- SQLAlchemy (version 2.0.21)
- werkzeug (version 2.2.3)

### Usage

To run the application, you simply need to run the `app.py` script in this repository. Once the application starts you should be able to access it locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Here you will be meet with the following two pages:

1. **Order List Page:** Navigate to the "Order List" page to view all existing orders. Use the pagination controls to navigate between pages.

2. **Add New Order Page:** Click on the "Add New Order" tab to access the order form. Complete all required fields and ensure that your entries meet the specified criteria.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Flask is used to build the backend of the application, handling routing, data processing, and interactions with the database.

- **Frontend:** The user interface is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.

- **Database:** The application employs an Azure SQL Database as its database system to store order-related data.
